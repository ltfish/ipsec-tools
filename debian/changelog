  * Update patch gcc-4.8.diff.
    As per NetBSD CVS, the memset is unneeded after (racoon_)calloc().
  * Support building with automake 1.14.
    Set required options to restore old automake behavior, and run
    autoreconf during build. Removed patches to configure, removed
    explicit rpath setting and chrpath. Dropped superfluous symbols
    files, as we are not a library package and these were probably
    added by accident.
  * Only use UTF8 encoding in ASN.1 strings.
    This is recommended by RFC2459 (2004), and has been made the default in
    OpenSSL 1.0.1h. Fixes the FTBFS caused by the OpenSSL change.

ipsec-tools (0.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload takes over maintainership of ipsec-tools.  I have already emailed
    Wichert Akkerman <wichert@wiggy.net>, and he has said this is good and OK.    
  * Converted templates to po-debconf.
  * Built support into debian/rules, templates and control files to allow
    easy building on woody as well as unstable. 
  * Rebuilt autoconf and libtool using latest versions in sid.  This should
    fix ARM compilation problems. 
  * Ported to sid.
  * Included patches and portablilty in debian/rules to make building
    on either tons easier.
